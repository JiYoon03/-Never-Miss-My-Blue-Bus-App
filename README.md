My app, Never Miss My Blue Bus, aims to enhance Bi-co student’s Blue Bus service. 
The app allows users to get the most upcoming blue bus schedule based on the location of the user. 
I converted the blue bus schedule data table into a swift dictionary format. 
I used xcode and Apple map to build the iOS app. 
My evaluation found out that Json format has more flexibility to change the schedule data than swift dictionary format. 
Since the app returns the user location with the blue bus stop is clear, these results were promising. 
The app successfully returns the upcoming schedule of either Bryn Mawr College or Haverford College based on the user location. 
Therefore, I satisfied the initial goal of creating an app that provides users with a comfortable way to check the bus schedule.
